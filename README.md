**Boring Space Dragon Adventure - The Text Based Game** <br>
Associated with Cambrian College Project<br>
2024<br>

The goal is to build a scaleable and customizable game using an API that I created. I developed 300 lines of code to make a complex game that can access information from the API. The API data will be hosted on GitHub. I used a spreadsheet to build out the content of the game and then convert it to JSON format for the API.<br>

The game involves exploring various cities around the world, interacting with characters, making choices, and experiencing random events. The player's goal is to navigate through different locations, manage their health, wallet, and bag while aiming to reach the win location, and avoid the lose locations.<br>
